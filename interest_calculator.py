# this program is about the absolute beginner and more advanced learner 
# high level interest program 
# simple interest program 
# IF YOU WANT OT make foundation of apptitude than call it number 
# the number is 8534005489

# si = p * r * t /100

principal = int(input("enter the principal :" ))
rate = int(input(" enter the rate :"))
time = int(input(" enter the time :" ))
# store all the variable / value of si 
simple interest = principal * rate * time / 100

# find the simple interest 

print(simple interest )


# short trick method which i am created here 

# let suppose p = 1000 , r =10, t = 2years , find the si = ?? . 
# jo principal hota ha bo apna aap ma 100 percent ke value rekhta ha 
# so, we can write this now and si = rt% 

#  now ->  1000*si/100
# 1000*20/100
# final answer is => 200 answer is correct.
